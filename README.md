# CompetitiveProgramming

## Overview 

Welcome to My COmpetitive Programing repository. This repository is my history on competitive progrmming, on and off, of course. 

When I was a kid, I did not like math. I made many petty mistakes, and I couldn't fully grasp the concept of numbers. Looking back, I want to embrace that part of me as well, because it made me improve on what I was good at at the point of time - English (and Japanese). After I discovered the wonders of programming in college, my skills soon came in handy - that I do not struggle with English. 






Welcome to Competitive Programming repository! This repository contains my (and others') codes for competitive programming. If I borrow someone's code, the referring URL is included in the file. 

## Structure 

### Contest 

This folder contains the codes I wrote during the competitive programming contests. ABC refers to contests from AtCoder and CF refers to contests from CodeForces. Each folder contains .py file per problem (A.py, B.py, ... etc). 

### Daily_Practice 

This folder contains the code I wrote on daily basis. The codes are to solve problems on AtCoder, CodeForces, and アルゴ式. 

### Library

This folder contains the snippets of functions and data structures that I am currently using. 

### Old Library

This folder contains the library of functions and data structures that I used in the competitive programming contests back in 2022. 

### Others 

This folder contains the codes and texts I wrote when I started learning Python. A lot of them contains my notes on the codes in Japanese, problem solving from some of the books, and solutions for the typical compeittive programming problems.
