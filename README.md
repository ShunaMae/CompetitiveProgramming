# CompetitiveProgramming

## Overview 

Welcome to Competitive Programming repository! This repository contains my (and others') codes for competitive programming. If I borrow someone's code, the referring URL is included in the file. 

## Structure 

### Contest 

This folder contains the codes I wrote during the competitive programming contests. ABC refers to contests from AtCoder and CF refers to contests from CodeForces. Each folder contains .py file per problem (A.py, B.py, ... etc). 

### Daily_Practice 

This folder contains the code I wrote on daily basis. The codes are to solve problems on AtCoder, CodeForces, and アルゴ式. 

### Library

This folder contains the snippets of functions and data structures that I am currently using. 

### Old Library

This folder contains the library of functions and data structures that I used in the competitive programming contests back in 2022. 

### Others 

This folder contains the codes and texts I wrote when I started learning Python. A lot of them contains my notes on the codes in Japanese, problem solving from some of the books, and solutions for the typical compeittive programming problems.
